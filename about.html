                        <p>Zhou Shuren was born in 1881 in Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, China. 
                                Penname: Lu Xun <br>
                                Born into a family that was traditional, wealthy, and esteemed. <br>
                                Zhou Shuren’s grandfather was a government official in Beijing. 
                                The family’s reputation would decline, in 1893 the grandfather was sentenced to prison for examination fraud.<br> 
                                Zhou Shuren’s father grew extremely sick due to these horrible circumstances. <br>
                                Zhou Shuren fled home and attended school in Nanjing. <br>
                                Traveled to Japan to study medicine. <br>
                                This took him to a medical college in the Japanese Countryside. His new goal was to return to China and cure patients similar to his father. He would also be willing to be an army doctor, not only to heal them but also to promote countrymen’s faith in reform. A social critique of medical care in China.<br>
                                We learn that the author was supposed to follow the traditional path and study the classics and take official examinations, and yet he chose to be labeled as a “social outcast” by studying foreign subjects.<br>
                                Published an “A Madman’s Diary” in 1918.<br>
                                Published: “The True Story of Ah Q” in 1922.<br>
                                Now living alone, transcribing works of literature his days are an endless loop of repetition. Until he has a wonderful encounter with an old friend and colleague. Here they discuss the Iron House and he is encouraged by friends to continue writing, so he begins writing some of his most notable work. <br>
                                In 1930 he became a nominal leader of the League of Left-Wing Writers. <br>
                                Although he refused to join the Chinese Communist Party, he believed they were the only salvation for his country. <br>
                                Often regarded as a Marxist, he would work closely with many anti-imperialist and anti-fascist groups. 
                                Zhou Shuren died in 1936 in Shanghai.
